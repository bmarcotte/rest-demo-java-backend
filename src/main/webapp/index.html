      This web application is a REST API backend that is meant to be called via a REST client frontend,
      and not accessed directly via a browser.  However, for testing purposes, you can use the following
      links to access the two calls that can be made via HTTP GET methods:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="/rest/bookmarks">All Bookmarks</a></li>
      <li><a href="/rest/bookmark/1">First Bookmark</a></li>
    </ul>
  </body>
